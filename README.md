## Converting an XD style file consisting of more than 10 pages to a complete frontend site 

The thing that I was strongly focusing on in this project is how to organize the CSS files because I found that the real hard job and messy stuff always locates in the CSS files, so I found some 
guy on youtube organizing all CSS messy stuff in a great way, and I went on with his same system editing it in a way make it better for me. 
I started by looking at the XD design capturing all common stuff like 
- the space between elements or sections
- colors,
- font sizes
- font families 
- style of heading
- the sub-headings

and then makes lots of utility classes for these common styles. I think it is an awesome way to handle all CSS and its value appears in multiple points:
- you almost no more have the dilemma of what to name your classes
- no more of figuring your way in the huge CSS files.
- much faster styling by just puting the utility class on the target element 

note: I didn't make all the utility classes from the beginning that's why my CSS file is not that small
